/**
 * Room entity representing a building in the local database.
 * A building belongs to a city, which belongs to a country.
 *
 * Database Relationship:
 * Country (1) ──→ (Many) City (1) ──→ (Many) Building
 * Building → City (Many-to-One)
 * City → Country (Many-to-One)
 * Building → Country (Indirect, through City)
 *
 * TODO #3: Add Room annotations for the Building entity
 *  1. Mark this class as @Entity with tableName = "buildings"
 *  2. Mark 'id' as @PrimaryKey (NOT auto-generated - comes from API)
 *  3. Add @ForeignKey constraint to link building to city:
 *     - entity = CityEntity::class
 *     - parentColumns = ["id"]  (CityEntity's primary key)
 *     - childColumns = ["cityId"]  (BuildingEntity's foreign key)
 *     - onDelete = ForeignKey.RESTRICT  (prevent deleting cities with buildings)
 *     - onUpdate = ForeignKey.CASCADE  (update buildingCityId when city id changes)
 *  4. Add indices for performance:
 *     - Index on "cityId" (for foreign key lookups and JOIN queries)
 *     - Index on "name" (for searching buildings by name)
 *
 *  HINT: A building belongs to a city (many-to-one relationship)
 *  HINT: RESTRICT prevents data loss - you can't delete a city that has buildings
 *
 *  Required imports:
 *  - androidx.room.Entity
 *  - androidx.room.PrimaryKey
 *  - androidx.room.ForeignKey
 *  - androidx.room.Index
